### Defining the Concept: What is Climate Change?

Climate change, in the most basic terms, is a significant shift in our planet's typical weather patterns. Now, this isn't about Mum's age-old complaint about the bitter cold or Dad grumbling about the extreme summer heat. We're talking long-term shifts over decades or even millions of years. That's right, buddy, it's not your everyday weather forecast chatter.

Climate change refers to changes in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, and a host of other meteorological elements, which might make your head spin faster than weather vane in a storm.
### Understanding the Science: How Does Climate Change Occur?

Let's not beat around the bush. Climate change happens when there's a significant shift in our planet's 'average weather.' What causes these shifts? Grab a comfy chair; this might take a minute.

Mainly, climate change is driven by certain 'natural' phenomena (like volcanic eruptions or solar irradiance changes) and 'human-induced' changes (like greenhouse gas emissions or land-use changes). So essentially, both Mother Nature and us homo sapiens are on center stage here.

### Broader Impact: The Links Between Climate Change and Human Health

Alright, this might sound like a connect-the-dots game, but bear with me. Climate change leads to more intense and frequent extreme weather eventsâ€”heatwaves, storms, floods, you name it. These disasters can cause immediate harm, but also possess long-tail effects like food scarcity and water contamination, leading to very real health impacts for us, the people.
